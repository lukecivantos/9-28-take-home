- What tradeoffs you make and why (e.g. speed vs quality)
- Code quality
- Communication of your end product and process

**Deliverables:**

# What kinds of practices should we look into?

- Gender disparities
- Disparities with leveling
- Bonus vs Salary
- Disparities with employment type

# Some notes on the data:

- All the employees are in the US
- Notably the roughly 500 employees are split up across about 100 cities all in the US. I'm going to focus moreso on other disparities.
- We need to resolve an issue where "full time" and "fullTime" don't match

# Initial go at what I want to display:

- Bar chart of gender salary + bonus by level
